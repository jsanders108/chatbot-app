# AI ChatBot App (powered by GPT-3)

This React app connects to the ChatGPT-3 API and allows users to ask questions and recieve AI responses.  

## Description

This app uses a simple chat interface to ask and receive questions. A user types in a question (a prompt), which is sent to the GPT-3 API. A response is received, which is then printed to the user interface. A record of the entire dialogue can be viewed.

Currently, the app can be run only on a local server. In other words, although the app can be viewed at the website below, the app on the website is not currently hooked up to the API. This is because costs are incurred every time a prompt is sent to the API and a response is received. I chose not to hook up the API to the public website because I don't know how much usage costs I will incur. 

If you would like a demo of the app, feel free to contact me below and I can show you how it works on my local enviromnent (via screen share).
