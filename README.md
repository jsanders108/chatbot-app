# AI ChatBot App (powered by GPT-3)

This React app connects to the GPT-3 API and allows users to ask questions and recieve AI responses.  

## Description

This app uses a simple chat interface to ask and receive questions. A user types in a question (a prompt), which is then sent to the GPT-3 API. A response is received, which is then printed to the user interface. A record of the entire dialogue is kept, which assists GPT-3 in its efforts to provide relevant responses. 

Currently, the app can be run only on my local server. In other words, although the app can be viewed at the website below, it is not currently functional because it is not hooked up to the GPT-3 API. I chose not to hook it up because I don't know how much usage the app will have. The GPT-3 API is not free; I am charged fees every time a prompt is sent to the API and a response is received. I also built in a 5-question limit, should I choose to hook up the API at some time in the future.  

If you would like to see how the app works, feel free to contact me at the email address below. I'd be happy to demo it on my private, local server via a screen share application.
